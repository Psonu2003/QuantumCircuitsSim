# QuantumCircuitsSim
This is my submission for the 2024 QOSF Mentorship Screening Task 1. This repo presents code comparing statevector and tensor simulations.

There is both a Python file and a Python notebook with the same solution. I included both if you wish to import some of these functions into your python code. The notebook has all my answers and data presented the best.
